# Face-Detection-and-Tracking

Face Detection and Tracking using computer vision and Haar Cascade frontal face algorithm

This project is used for detecting and tracking face using Haar Cascade Frontal Face Algorithm

Haar Cascade Frontal Face Algorithm is based on the Haar Wavelet technique to analyze pixels in the image into squares by function. 

This algorithm uses machine learning techniques to get a high degree of accuracy from “training data”. 

Haar Cascades use the Adaboost learning algorithm which selects a small number of important features from a large set to give an efficient result of classifiers.

Work Flow of Face Detection & Tracking :

Step 1 : Loading Haar Cascade Face Algorithm.
Step 2 : Initializing Camera.
Step 3 : Reading Frame from Camera.
Step 4 : Converting Color image to Gray scale image.
Step 5 : Obtaining Face coordinates by passing algorithm.
Step 6 : Drawing Rectangle on the Face Coordinates.
Step 7 : Displaying the Output frame.
